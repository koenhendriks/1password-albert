# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Albert module interface version](https://github.com/albertlauncher/plugins/blob/master/python/README.md#the-python-module-interface-specification).
